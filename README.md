# The bank app for the bank "Korrupt bank" (corrupt bank)

This app is developed with the kids in Coding Pirates from the PHP workshop. Coding Pirates is a non profit organisation, where we, as an after school activity, teach kids to program, and do other creative stuff with a computer.

This program is developed at the Coding Pirates IT University department.
